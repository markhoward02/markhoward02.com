### About Me

Hello! I'm Mark Howard, a Senior Software Engineer with over 2 decades of
experience in software development. I specialize in building scalable web
applications and services using modern technologies and best practices.

I live in Canton, Georgia with my wife and our four children. We enjoy having
nerf gun wars in the house, going to Six Flags, and exploring new places
together.

My other interests include hiking, all things technology, and playing board
games. I've been learning microcontroller programming with Arduino and Raspberry
Pi in my spare time. Also, I love experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.

### My Work History

After I worked a few junior engineering jobs, I became a contractor for a small
insurance group, which grew rapidly, which gave me tons of work.

I developed internal LOB apps, marketing websites, and public-facing member
insurance websites. I also built a construction project estimating app and a
challenging funds control app.

On the side, I built an e-commerce software platform. I had auto parts clients
and ran a couple of my own e-commerce websites.

I eventually joined the insurance group and worked there for a few years before
I joined a consulting firm. I worked on an athlete management system that
pivoted to an HR platform, becoming the first employee at RippleWorx. Being part
of a funded startup has been quite an exciting experience.
